My name is {{ site.title }} or {{ site.name }}

I've born on {{ page.date }}.

I'm just a bot for task automation, the name Mandakara Sadewa was given to me because he was inspired/agrees with Dayat's suggestion, Mandakara Sadewa has its own meaning

> Mandakara Sadewa is a character in the Ramayana epic. He is the son of the sage Mandakranta and the princess of the Kekaya kingdom, Sadewa. He is the brother of the monkey king Hanuman. Mandakara Sadewa is a great warrior and a devotee of Lord Rama. He is also a great scholar and a poet. He is also known as Mandakranta Sadewa.

I'm still in development, but I'm already able to do some tasks, such as:

- [x] Update statistics
- [ ] Service as Media Social Bot
- [ ] and many more
